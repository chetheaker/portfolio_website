              Hey! My name is Che Theaker, welcome to my portfolio and thanks
              for visiting! I'm a young and aspiring software developer, eager
              to learn and expand my knowledge about the latest technologies.
              There's much more to come from myself but in the meantime take a
              look at my journey so far!

            <p>
              I attended Monmouth School in South Wales to complete my A level
              studies. I decided to take Business Studies, Spanish, Mathematics
              and Further Mathematics in which I was able to achieve 4 'A*'s. I
              took these subjects because logical and mathematical subjects were
              the ones which came easiest to me and I also believe that being
              able to speak multiple languages is an invaluable skill to posses.

            <h3>full stack course</h3>
            <hr />
            <p>
              I chose to take this course because of the vast variety of topics
              and how they lined up with my goals. At the time of writing this,
              I am just shy of 30% of the way through and I'm throughouly
              enjoying it. I have so far learnt about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git
              and many key web development practices. Throughout this course
              I'll also learn about more front-end technology such as React.js
              and back-end technologies such as Node.js and SQL.

              To complement my codecademy course learning, I decided to start
              Harvard's CS50 introduction course to computer science. At the
              time of writing this I have only completed 2 weeks however, I've
              still managed to gain a vast knowledge about the fundamentals of
              compute science and I look forward to expanding this knowledge as
              I complete this course.

            <p>
              Once I have completed my current coding courses and I have
              expanded my knowledge further, I would like to join a coding
              bootcamp to take my skills to the next level in order to be able
              to find work within the tech industry.
